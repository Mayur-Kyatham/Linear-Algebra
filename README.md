# Linear Algebra

What you'll learn

-Represent data as vectors and matrices and identify their properties using concepts of singularity, rank, and linear independence

-Apply common vector and matrix algebra operations like dot product, inverse, and determinants

-Express certain types of matrix operations as linear transformation, and apply concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to machine learning problems

# Week 1: Systems of Linear equations

Matrices are commonly used in machine learning and data science to represent data and its transformations. In this week, you will learn how matrices naturally arise from systems of equations and how certain matrix properties can be thought in terms of operations on system of equations.

# Linear Algebra

What you'll learn

~Represent data as vectors and matrices and identify their properties using concepts of singularity, rank, and linear independence

-Apply common vector and matrix algebra operations like dot product, inverse, and determinants

-Express certain types of matrix operations as linear transformation, and apply concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to machine learning problems

# Week 1: Systems of Linear equations

Matrices are commonly used in machine learning and data science to represent data and its transformations. In this week, you will learn how matrices naturally arise from systems of equations and how certain matrix properties can be thought in terms of operations on system of equations.

Learning Objectives

-Form and graphically interpret 2x2 and 3x3 systems of linear equations

-Determine the number of solutions to a 2x2 and 3x3 system of linear equations

-Distinguish between singular and non-singular systems of equations

-Determine the singularity of 2x2 and 3x3 system of equations by calculating the determinant


# Week 2: Solving systems of linear equations

In this week, you will learn how to solve a system of linear equations using the elimination method and the row echelon form. You will also learn about an important property of a matrix: the rank. The concept of the rank of a matrix is useful in computer vision for compressing images.

Learning Objectives

-Solve a system of linear equations using the elimination method.

-Use a matrix to represent a system of linear equations and solve it using matrix row reduction.

-Solve a system of linear equations by calculating the matrix in the row echelon form.

-Calculate the rank of a system of linear equations and use the rank to determine the number of solutions of the system.
